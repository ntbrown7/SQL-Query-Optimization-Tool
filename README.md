# SQL Query Optimization Tool

## Overview
The SQL Query Optimization Tool is a Python-based application designed to analyze and suggest optimizations for SQL queries. This tool aims to enhance database performance by identifying and rectifying inefficiencies in SQL queries.

## Features
- **Query Execution:** Executes SQL queries against a specified database.
- **Analysis:** Analyzes queries for common inefficiencies and performance issues.
- **Optimization Suggestions:** Provides suggestions to optimize SQL queries based on the analysis.
- **Support for SQLite:** Currently supports SQLite databases with potential for extension.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- SQLite3 (for SQLite databases)
- sqlparse (Python library)

## Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the sqlparse library using pip:

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `sql_optimization_tool.py` script in a text editor.
3. Modify the `connection` string to point to your SQLite database.
4. Replace the sample SQL query in the `main` function with your query.
5. Run the script:

## How It Works
- The tool connects to the specified SQLite database.
- Executes the provided SQL query.
- Analyzes the executed query using basic syntactic analysis.

# Setting Up the Demo Database
1. A sample SQL script (`demo_database.sql`) is provided to create a demo database for testing.
2. Run the SQL script in your SQLite environment to set up the demo database with sample tables and data.
```sql
-- Execute this in your SQLite environment
.read demo_database.sql
